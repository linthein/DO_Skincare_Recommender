# TestForSimbolo-16

This project aims to develop a skincare product recommendation system using machine learning techniques. By leveraging TF-IDF and cosine similarity algorithms, the system effectively analyzes product descriptions, allowing for accurate recommendations based on user preferences.

The system incorporates user-defined parameters such as skin type, desired effects, and skin problems to generate tailored product suggestions. By considering factors like product category, notable effects, and user-specified criteria, the system provides a personalized experience for skincare consumers.

The project successfully demonstrates the application of machine learning to a real-world problem, offering a potential solution to the challenges faced by consumers when selecting suitable skincare products.
